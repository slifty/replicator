The Replicator
==========

Distributed, redundant, file sharing using fair use RTs

This is a platform that allows people to anonymously share and distribute messages using RTs.  Any user can submit an arbitrary chunk of text which can then be syndicated and shared in structured pieces using Twitter.

When combined with The Collector (https://github.com/slifty/collector) this tool makes it possible for an individual to use a 
crowd to send a collective messages.

I'm really sorry this is in PHP, I hope you forgive me.
